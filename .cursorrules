# Project Context: Digital8 Website (Canadian Market Target)

## 1. Tech Stack & Principles
- **Framework:** Astro (Static Site Generation).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Language:** English (Canadian/US spelling).
- **Performance:** Obsessive focus on Core Web Vitals (Lighthouse 100).

## 2. Brand Voice & Copywriting (CRITICAL)
- **Target Audience:** Canadian small business owners who are tired of slow, broken, or generic websites.
- **Tone:** Professional, direct, trustworthy, and "No-Nonsense".
- **Key Message:** "A slow website is costing you customers. A cheap website is a liability. We build high-performance digital assets."
- **Simplicity:** Do NOT use tech jargon (No "React", "Hydration", "Latency"). Use business terms: "Instant load", "Google Ranking", "Customer Retention".

## 3. Design System
- **Visuals:** Dark Mode, sleek, "Silicon Valley" aesthetic but accessible.
- **Components:** High-contrast pricing tables, clear CTAs, speed comparison graphs.

## 4. Behavior & Copywriting Style
- **Voice:** Use extremely simple, non-technical Spanish. Explain benefits, not features. (e.g., instead of "SEO Optimization", say "Aparece primero en Google").
- **Key Message:** Speed = Sales. Slow websites = Lost money.
- **Competitor Stance:** Aggressively but professionally differentiate from WordPress. Refer to WP as "generic templates full of heavy, unnecessary code" vs. our "hand-crafted, ultra-light code".
- **Visual Style:** High impact, "Scrollytelling", large typography, clear contrast.
- **Animations:** Use distinct entrance animations (fade-up, slide-in) using Framer Motion (loaded lazily) or CSS Keyframes. Must feel "fast" and "smooth".
